# States

A state is another type of data storage on the Ethereum blockchain. It is the value of a variable defined in a smart contract. In addition to the transaction data, you often need to work with states 

{% hint style="info" %}
For example,  the value of total Livepeer token that is staked in the network is stored in a variable called _totalBonded_. It can be retrieved by calling the function [_getTotalBonded_](https://github.com/livepeer/protocol/blob/master/contracts/bonding/BondingManager.sol#L928)_._
