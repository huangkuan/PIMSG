# Overview

The Chart Creator is a data visualization tool. It allows you to explore the Ethereum blockchain data without writing a single line of code or SQL query. 

To have a quick idea of how Chart Creator works, we recommend you [Get Started](get-started.md).

In this tutorial, you will create a chart that visualizes the daily transaction amount of an ERC20 token. You will explore the most popular data source "_transactions_", the most common data transformation techniques and different types of visualizations that Scout provides.

After you get a taste of ****the creator, let's get to the [Pipeline](stages/) section. In this section, you will learn a few classic techniques that can help search and transform blockchain data into different formats before you visualize it. This is the most important and fun step when creating a chart.

Pipeline is short for "Data processing pipeline".  It's a series of steps that a data analyst takes when he/she analyzes data. At each step, an analyst applies an instruction on how the data should be transformed and the output is the result of the transformation. The output then becomes the input of the next step. The process continues until the pipeline is completed.

The next step is [Visualization](visualizations.md). Scout provides a good number of options for data visualizations. This section is pretty straightforward.

By now, you must be ready to explore more on chain data. Let us open up the Scout kimono a little bit. We have prepared a number of data sources for you to explore. Check out this section.

One of the biggest challenges when exploring Ethereum data is to have protocol specific knowledge. Most  of these knowledges are either inside the brain of the developers
