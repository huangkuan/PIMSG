# Overview

The Chart Creator is a data transformation and visualization tool. It allows you to explore the Ethereum blockchain application data without writing a single line of code or SQL query. 

To have a quick idea of how Chart Creator works, we recommend you checking out [Get Started](get-started.md).

In this tutorial, you will create a chart that visualizes the daily transaction amount of an ERC20 token. You will explore the most popular data source "_transactions_", the most common data transformation techniques and different types of visualizations that Scout provides.

After you get a taste of ****the creator, we recommend you studying the **Pipelines** section. In this section, you will learn a few common techniques that can transform blockchain application data into different formats before you visualize it. You can group, filter,  slice and dice the data anyway you like. This is the most important and fun step when creating a chart.

**Pipelines** is short for "Data processing pipelines".  It's a series of steps that a data analyst takes when he/she analyzes data. At each step, an analyst applies an instruction on how the data should be transformed and the output is the result of the transformation. The output then becomes the input of the next step. The process continues until the pipeline is completed.

Blockchain application data must be processed before any visualizations can be applied.

The next step is **Visualization**. Scout provides a good number of options for data visualizations. This section is pretty straightforward.

By now, you must be a pro. Let us open up the Scout kimono a little bit more. We have prepared a number of data sources for you to explore.
