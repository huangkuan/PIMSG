# Pipeline

Pipeline is a series of steps that you would take to "massage" the data before you visualize them. At each step, you apply one instruction to transform the data and the result of the transformation will be the input of your next step. You keep doing it until the data is fully processed. Scout currently support  Filter, Project, Sort, Unwind, Group and Custom.
